#### Transcode Video Bash Script
## Davinci Resolve in Linux has poor compatibility to AV Format recordings. This script transcode the videoes in .mov format

### How it works
## It checks user's current directory for any videos and prompt users to select from (1-2-3)
## It asks if you want to create a new output folder or to save in current directory
## if current directory, want to rename the video to avoid conflict
